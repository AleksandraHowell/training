# Sub-queries
* We can `select` from tables
* A `select` statement returns a **result set**, which is in the same format as a table
* So we can do nested `select` statements

```
select e_name bahhh from employee;
```

```
select sheep.bahhh from (
    select e_name bahhh from employee
) sheep;
```
